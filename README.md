## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
While building this app the challenges I faced were the CSS of the website. My understanding of CSS was always rusty but seeing as that I was able to get a better understanding of div classes it made my life easier. I also encountered a roadblock when creating props for the card function but then I was able to overcome it with trial and error and have a better understanding of props and deconstruction.
